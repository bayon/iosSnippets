 #### Changing companies (swipe up and down)
 
 When swiping the screen up and down the property will change to the next property that is available and the background color of the stats area will be different for that company.
 
 **Interaction**: The property name + date indication + message count cell should remain anchored at the top of the view until the next property reaches the bottom of that cell and pushes it out of the way as the user is scrolling.
 
 (See instagram app)
 
 **Companies should be listed in alphabetical order**
 
 
 #### Quickly switching companies (pinch)
 
 When the user pinches the main screen area the view will collapse down into a summary view only showing the property name + date indication + message count.  This will allow a user to quickly scroll through all the available companies if there are many.
 
 When collapsed if a user touches a property the name / summary cell will be anchored at the top of the screen and the stats view will open.
 
 (This pinch for summary view can be seen in the built in iOS weather app)
