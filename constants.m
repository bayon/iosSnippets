 FOUNDATION_EXPORT NSString *const MyFirstConstant;
 FOUNDATION_EXPORT NSString *const MySecondConstant;
 //etc.
 (you can use extern instead of FOUNDATION_EXPORT if your code will not be used in mixed C/C++ environments or on other platforms)
 
 You can include this file in each file that uses the constants or in the pre-compiled header for the project.
 
 You define these constants in a .m file like
 
 // Constants.m
 NSString *const MyFirstConstant = @"FirstConstant";
 NSString *const MySecondConstant = @"SecondConstant";
 Constants.m should be added to your application/framework's target so that it is linked in to the final product.
