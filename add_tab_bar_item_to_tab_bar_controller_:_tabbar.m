//Add Tab Bar Item To Tab Bar Controller : Tabbar
 The second view controller may be added to the storyboard simply by dragging and dropping one from the Object Library panel (View -> Utilities -> Show Object Library). Once the new view controller has been added to the storyboard canvas, select it so that it is highlighted with a blue border and then display the Identity Inspector panel (View -> Utilities -> Show Identity Inspector). Within the inspector panel change the Class setting from UIViewController to Tab2ViewController.
 
 With the storyboard view controller mapped to our Tab2ViewController class we now need to establish a relationship between the view controller and the Tab Bar Controller. To achieve this simply Ctrl-click on the Tab Bar Controller object in the storyboard canvas and drag the line to the Tab2ViewController. Upon releasing the line select the Relationship â€“ viewControllers menu option as illustrated in Figure 16 3. This will add the Tab2ViewController to the viewControllers property of the Tab Bar Controller object so that it will be included in the tab navigation.
