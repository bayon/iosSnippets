 ### Description

   The AA Stats App will be a 'page-based' application similar to the Weather application that ships with iOS. The number of pages corresponds to the properties the user has access to. These properties will be returned during the login request.

   Each page will be a single view for the property and will show stats for the property.

   The application must have a settings view where the user can update their saved credentials.
